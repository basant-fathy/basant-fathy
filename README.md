## 🚀 About Me
<img align="right" src="https://c.tenor.com/_DOBjnGspYAAAAAM/code-coding.gif" width="200" alt="Coding GIF"/>

I'm a student passionate about programming and continuous learning.  
Currently focusing on **C++**, **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, and **Problem Solving**, while building real projects to apply what I learn step by step.

I'm following **Abu-Hadhoud Roadmap (Programming Advices)** and documenting my full learning journey on GitHub to reflect practical understanding, not just theory.

### 🔗 [**My Programming Learning Journey Repo**](https://github.com/basant-fathy/Programming-Learning-Journey)
I document my structured learning path, courses, certificates, and applied tasks On This Repository.
